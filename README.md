# Crash Team Mod - Portable App

This is a **portable app**. 

The only requirement is to have **.NET Framework 3.5** installed, as the app is built in C#.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:

- Ensure that folder and ROM names do **not** contain spaces. For example:  
  `C:\Crash team Racing\c tr.bin` should be `C:\Crash-Team-Racing\c-tr.bin`.

- This app is likely **only compatible with Crash Team Racing (CTR)**. Compatibility with other games is not guaranteed.

- Not all options from **PSX-MODDING-TOOLCHAIN** are currently supported.

- If the CMD unexpectedly prompts you for input (e.g., in case of an error), simply press the **"Restart"** button.

- **This is a beta app.** Bugs and instability are to be expected.

- You need to download **ctr-mod-sdk** to use this app.

- Compilation logs are stored in the `gcc-out.txt` file.

- If you are compiling you would need to extract the **python.part1.rar** **python.part2.rar**
  in tools folder before anything.

- Any feedback regarding bugs would be greatly appreciated!

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps to Use:

1. Open `Crash Team Mod.exe`.

2. Locate a ROM on your computer (it can be in any folder, but make sure the path **does not contain spaces**).

3. Select the version of your ROM (USA, JAP, PAL).

4. Find the `buildList.txt` file inside the `ctr-mod-sdk` folder and drag it into the gray rectangle labeled **"DRAG BUILDLIST"**.

5. Now you can:
   - Compile
   - Build the ROM
   - Create Xdelta patches  
     ...and more!
